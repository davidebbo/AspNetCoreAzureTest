# AspNetCoreAzureTest

Problem: I'm unable to deploy an ASP.NET Core 1.0 app to Azure App Service when there are referenced .NET Core 1.0 class libraries.

Repro steps:

** This works **
1) Create a ASP.NET Core 1.0 Web App in Visual Studio 2015 w/ Update 3 and RTM tooling.
2) Commit to git (see commit `7b187403`)
3) Set up Shared Azure App Service ([http://aspnetcoreazuretest.azurewebsites.net](http://aspnetcoreazuretest.azurewebsites.net/))
4) Set the Deployment Source as git
5) Monitor the deployment, and see that it eventually succeeds.
6) Visit the website and see the default ASP.NET Core 1.0 website as generated by Visual Studio.

** This is where it fails **
